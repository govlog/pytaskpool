    # this function wait 1 second before return
    def my_func(x):
        sleep(1)
        return [x ** x]

    # create a pool of 8 process
    mypool = tp.TaskPool([], 8)

    # launch my_func eight times
    for r in range(8):
        tp.launch(my_func, r)

    #display results
    for r in tp.get_sorted_results():
        print r

Result of execution:
::
    gov@dev:~$ time python example.py
    [1]
